A very basic implementation of Random Forest Regression in python. The sklearn.ensemble library is used to import the RandomForestRegressor class. The object of the class is created and is given a given an n_estimators value of 300. The n_estimator value is the number of Decision Tree Regression models to be included into the Random Forest Regressor model. The higer the value of the n_estimator, the more Decision Tree models added. And the more Decision Tree models added, the better the model is at predicting values of the dataset.



Those who want to practice with Random_Forest_Regression in python that time its repo is vary reliable because i used comment in every section.
